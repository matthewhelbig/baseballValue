The goal of this project is to identify the attributes of the players with the most value and the least value,
as well as predicting which players will have the most and least value in the future.

The first step we'll take is identify which datasets we'll be working with. The Lahman Database has a lot of good information that we'll need, namely Player Value data, salary, and dates of birth. 

We'll download that from <http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/>
